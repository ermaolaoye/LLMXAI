Okay, so I need to help extract fuzzy membership functions for each column in the given JSON dataset using the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm. The target variable is 'y', which we should exclude from our analysis.

First, let's look at the structure of the input. The database name is "Bank Marketing Dataset," and it's about direct marketing campaigns for a Portuguese bank. The data includes various features like age, balance, job types, marital status, education, etc., with binary indicators for each category (e.g., job_admin., job_blue-collar).

The task is to process each non-target column and determine the number of clusters (membership functions), their shapes, and appropriate names.

Starting with numerical columns: 'age', 'balance', 'day', 'duration', 'campaign', 'pdays', 'previous'. These are continuous variables. For FCM, we typically use Gaussian membership functions because they can model overlapping clusters well. The number of clusters depends on the data distribution. Let's assume 3 clusters for each as a starting point unless there's a reason to choose more or fewer.

For binary columns like job types (job_admin., etc.), since they have only two values, we treat them as crisp membership functions with two clusters eachâ€”True and False.

Categorical variables represented by multiple binary columns (like education_primary, education_secondary) should be handled similarly. Each binary column will have two crisp clusters.

Now, let's go through each column:

1. **age**: Continuous, so 3 Gaussian clusters.
2. **balance**: Can be negative or positive; maybe 3 clusters to capture different ranges.
3. **day**: Ranges from 1-31; perhaps 3 clusters for early, mid, late month.
4. **duration**: Time spent on calls; likely 3 clusters for short, medium, long.
5. **campaign**: Number of contacts made; maybe 3 clusters for low, medium, high.
6. **pdays**: Days since last contact; could be treated similarly to campaign.
7. **previous**: Previous contacts; again, 3 clusters.

For binary columns:
- Each job type (e.g., job_admin.) has two crisp clusters: True and False.
- Similarly for marital status, education levels, default, housing, loan, contact methods, months, poutcome.

I need to ensure that each column is processed correctly. For example, 'marital_divorced' is a binary indicator; it should have two crisp clusters named accordingly.

Also, the output must be valid JSON with proper structure: database_name and membership_functions object containing each column's details.

Potential issues:
- Some columns might have more than two values if not properly encoded. But in this dataset, all non-target columns are either numerical or binary.
- Ensuring that all columns are included in the output, even those with only one value (though in this case, they're all binary or numerical).

I think I've covered all necessary points. Now, structuring the JSON accordingly, making sure each column has the correct number of clusters and shapes, especially handling binary as crisp.
